## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a little about how to use grid in combination with flex for a better visual experience for the user.
I used flex in various styles, but i used grid for the card container.

```css
main {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
.card-container {
  height: 500px;
  width: 320px;

  background-color: var(--white);
  border-radius: 20px;

  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 50% 1fr 10%;

  box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px -1px #000;
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to improve my skills in laying out elements using CSS, with flexbox and grid.
